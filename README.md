# GAMIFICATION WELLNESS KICKSTART
Right now, my workplace is entering a three-month wellness program challenge. So, I came up with an idea to gamify this three-month program. The idea is simple: we need to make the competition more interesting by adding gamification elements to this program, such as an exercise challenge (do any exercise with a target number of repetitions; if you meet or even exceed the target, then you get a score). The idea involves integrating computer vision/artificial intelligence into this program. One application is using YOLO to count push-ups (or any exercise you can think of). Let's say you set a target of 10 reps of push-ups, then you earn a score of 5. For every rep above the target, you earn one point. Completing 15 reps should earn you a score of 20, and so on. Another idea is to estimate the calories of your food using AI, as well as the healthiness of your food. Say you eat pecel (an Indonesian dish), which consists of vegetables, peanut sauce, maybe protein (such as egg, meat, or chicken), and a carb source such as rice. It's a pretty well-balanced dish (despite the fact the sauce itself is high in sugar and salt, but well, that's pretty okay), but depending on the portion, the calorie value can vary. The lower the calories, the healthier the food; you earn another score. But before we go too far, let's start with something simple such as a push-up counter.
